/**
 * Plugin Name: Members
 * Plugin URI: http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/09/17/members-wordpress-plugin
 * Description: A user, role, and content management plugin for controlling permissions and access. A plugin for making WordPress a more powerful <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>.
 * Version: 0.1.1
 * Author: Justin Tadlock
 * Author URI: http://justintadlock.com
 *
 * The members plugin was created because the WordPress community is lacking
 * a solid permissions plugin that is both open source and works completely within the
 * confines of the APIs in WordPress.  But, the plugin is so much more than just a
 * plugin to control permissions.  It is meant to extend WordPress by making user,
 * role, and content management as simple as using the system altogether.
